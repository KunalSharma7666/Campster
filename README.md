#Campster

Developed a website that allows users to create, edit & delete camps & can add reviews to them. Created the backend on Node.js & Express.js. Used Bootstrap to style the website. The data is saved & fetched from local MongoDB. Wrote middleware to implement authentication & authorization of users by Passport.js
